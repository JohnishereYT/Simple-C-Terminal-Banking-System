This is a very simple terminal C++ project i made in C++.


This project simulates a basic bank system where you can check your balance, 
deposit money, and withdraw money. It helped me practice variables, functions, loops, and input/output in C++!


**Please note:**
**1.** I am learning and I am a beginner! It may not be made/programmed very good, and there definitely might be bugs in this project... But please forgive me for that XD
  
**2.** This is a terminal project, as mentioned at the very first line of this README
   
**3.** I got the idea for this project from Bro Code, as i am watching his free course for C++. So a very big shoutout to him!
   
**4.** I did this all my myself! Although Bro Code gave me the idea for it, and helped me with stuff like std::setprecision, i decided to not watch _all_ of it and instead make it on my own! (very proud of that)


Ok, have fun playing it! :D
